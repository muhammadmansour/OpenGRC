        WathbaGRC is a fast, free, lightweight, and opinionated cyber GRC tools for managing and auditing standards,
        controls, implementations of those controls. This version is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use
        in a production environment.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold ">Getting Started</h2>
        <div class="p-3">
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                <li class="pl-2"><strong>Create a new standard - </strong>Multiple sample standards have been created
                    for you, but you can freely add more Standards.<br></li>

                <li class="pl-2"><strong>Create controls for your standard - </strong>This has been done for the default
                    standards, but you can add more controls as you like.<br>
                </li>
                <li class="pl-2"><strong>Create your implementations - </strong>On each control, you can add
                    "implementations" to describe how you implement that control. For example: A control may require
                    EDR. In your implementation you
                    may talk about how you implement that with Windows Defender.<br></li>
                <li class="pl-2"><strong>Perform an Audit - </strong>Now that you have your data in the system, you can
                    now perform an audit to determine effectiveness of your implementations!<br></li>
